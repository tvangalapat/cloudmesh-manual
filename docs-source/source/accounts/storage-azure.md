# Microsoft Cloud Computing Service

## Azure

Microsoft Azure (formerly Windows Azure) is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

Azure has over 600 services, inclding compute, mobile sevice, storage service, data management, messaging and so on. In this case, Azure itself is a multi-functional platform. As for the compute service, which is the core part for cloud computing, it provides virtual machines allowing users to launch general-purpose Microsoft Windows and Linux virtual machines, as well as preconfigured machine images for popular software packages. The app services environment lets developers easily publish and manage websites. Azure provides all its services to users based on website, so users do not need to install any kind of software in order to implement cloud computing or use other services;

##Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is a command-line tool providing a great experience for managing Azure resources. You can access all azure servies by just typing command on your local shell.

Before you begin to use this tool to communicate with azure, you first need to install Azure CLI on your own computer. The next link provide steps in greate detail about how to install it on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu system.

<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest>

Here I will use Ubuntu system as an example to install Azure CLI. First you need to check if you have installed curl by typing the next command in your shell:

```python
$curl --version
```

If no error returns, you have successfully installed curl already. Otherwise, you need to run the next command to install curl first. After finishing, you are able to run the former command to check if you have installed curl successfully.

```python
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install curl
```

The Azure CLI offers and maintains a script which runs all of the installation commands in one step. You just need to run the next command as superuser:

```python
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

When the installation is finished, you can test your az command by trying to use it to connect to your azure account. Type the next command in your bash:

```python
$az login
```

If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load a sign-in page.Otherwise, you need to open a browser page and follow the instructions on the command line to enter an authorization code after navigating to https://aka.ms/devicelogin in your browser. After doing that, you need to sign in with your account credentials in the browser.

Once all these steps are done correctly, then we can use the Azure CLI interface to connect to our Azure account and manage our virutal machine.
